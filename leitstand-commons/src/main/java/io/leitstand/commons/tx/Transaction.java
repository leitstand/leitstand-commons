 * Nested transactions are not supported.
 * Instead a transaction is <em>suspended</em> when a new transaction is started and resumed after the new transaction is completed.
 * All fetched entity are attached to the transaction that loaded the entity and are detached when accessed after the transaction ended.
 * A detached entity can be merged back into a running transaction via {@link Repository#merge(Object)}.
 * It is recommended to all entities from the repository instance, that is passes as argument to this transaction.
 * If entities are passed by reference, the entities are detached and must be attached to the transaction again.
